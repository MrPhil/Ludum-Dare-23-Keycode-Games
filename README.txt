	 * ========================================================
	 * LUDUM DARE 23 KEYNOTE GAMES
	 * 2012 (c) Chevy Ray Johnston
	 * ========================================================
	 * 
	 * These games are made with FlashPunk, a game engine which
	 * is freely available for you to use! Check it out at:
	 * 
	 * flashpunk.net
	 * flashpunk.net/learn
	 * flashpunk.net/forums
	 * 
	 * You are totally free to use any of the code in this in
	 * your games! So enjoy :) hope some of it is helpful!
	 * 
	 * ========================================================
	 * INSTRUCTIONS
	 * ========================================================
	 * 
	 * I just put all 9 of the games in one source, to make it
	 * simpler to distribute! Each game's objects are in its own
	 * folder (eg. objects/dungeon, objects/racing). The versions
	 * with "3" at the end are the improved ones with graphics!
	 * 
	 * To switch games, just change the current FlashPunk "world",
	 * in the code below, I've commented out the other games, so
	 * just switch which line is uncommented to try out the others.
	 * 
	 * If you have any questions about this, feel free to email me:
	 * 
	 * happytrash@gmail.com
	 * 
	 * ========================================================
	 * 
	 * Break a leg, jammers!
